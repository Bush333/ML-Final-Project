# ML-Final-Project

This is a project for Machine-Learning Final Exam. 

We tend to build a student intervention system predicting the performance of a student in his/her exams.
There are many courses offered in today’s world, and reports suggest that the high attrition rate and low completion rate are significant concerns. 
Identifying students who are at risk of withdrawal and failure is required. 
We aim to predict whether students will be able to graduate or not based on their family, academic, and health background. 
As it’s a classification problem, we used several supervised classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes etc.We have calculated the F1 score for these algorithms. 
Upon comparison based on the F1 score, we found that SVM provided better prediction as compared to the other algorithms.We have approximately 1000 students’ secondary education records from two Portuguese schools. 
Datasets have the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese language, including student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features.
